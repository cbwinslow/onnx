## Description
This model predicts handwritten digits using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

### Dataset
The model has been trained on the popular [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

### Source
The model is trained in CNTK following the tutorial [CNTK 103D: Convolutional Neural Network with MNIST](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/Tutorials/CNTK_103D_MNIST_ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork.ipynb). Note that the specific architecture used is the model with alternating convolution and max pooling layers (found under the "Solution" section at the end of the tutorial).

### Demo
[Run MNIST in browser](https://microsoft.github.io/onnxjs-demo/#/mnist) - implemented by ONNX.js with MNIST version 1.2

## Inference
We used CNTK as the framework to perform inference. A brief description of the inference process is provided below:

### Input
Input tensor has shape `(1x1x28x28)`, with type of float32.      
One image at a time. This model doesn't support mini-batch.      

### Preprocessing
Images are resized into (28x28) in grayscale, with a black background and a white foreground (the number should be in white). Color value is scaled to [0.0, 1.0]. 

Example:
```python
import numpy as np
import cv2

image = cv2.imread('input.png')
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
gray = cv2.resize(gray, (28,28)).astype(np.float32)/255
input = np.reshape(gray, (1,1,28,28)
```

### Output
The likelihood of each number before [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function), with shape of `(1x10)`.

### Postprocessing
Route the model output through a softmax function to map the aggregated activations across the network to probabilities across the 10 classes.

### Sample test data
Sets of sample input and output files are provided in
* serialized protobuf TensorProtos (`.pb`), which are stored in the folders `test_data_set_*/`.
